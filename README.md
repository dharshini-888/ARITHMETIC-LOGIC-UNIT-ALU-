VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) is a technology that enables the integration of millions of transistors and electronic components onto a single microchip, forming complex integrated circuits (ICs). It is widely used in designing and manufacturing microprocessors, memory chips, and other digital circuits for devices like smartphones, computers, and IoT systems. VLSI enhances performance, reduces power consumption, and minimizes chip size through advanced fabricationÂ processes.
